A reverse proxy is a server that sits between clients and backend servers, forwarding client requests to the appropriate backend service and returning the server's response to the client. Implementing a reverse proxy with HTTP/2 support involves:

1. Accepting client connections over HTTP/2.
2. Forwarding requests to backend servers, potentially over HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2.
3. Handling TLS encryption and certificate management.
4. Managing concurrent streams and efficient resource utilization.
